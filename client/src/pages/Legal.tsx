            All performance figures presented on this website, including backtested results, are
            hypothetical and for illustrative purposes only. Backtested performance does not represent
            actual trading results and has inherent limitations. Actual results may differ materially
            from backtested results due to market conditions, execution costs, timing, and other factors.
            The backtesting methodology applies realistic transaction costs and walk-forward
            validation across the period 2015 to 2026. Past performance, whether actual or simulated, is not indicative of future

            limited power of attorney. Halfacre Research has no withdrawal rights over client funds at
